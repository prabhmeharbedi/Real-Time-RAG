        "Some of the retrieval metrics are:\n",
        "- `Hit@k`: Measures the proportion of times that the relevant item appears in the top-K retrieved results. This can be also mentioned as `\"Context Recall\"`, that is assuming there is only one relevant document.\n",
        "- `Context Recall`: Focuses on the comprehensiveness of the retrieved context, measuring the proportion of all relevant documents in the corpus that are successfully retrieved. It is formally defined as `(Number of Relevant Items Retrieved) / (Total Number of Relevant Items in Corpus)`. In simpler terms, recall tells you \"Of all the relevant documents that could have been retrieved, how many were actually retrieved?\". High recall signifies that your retrieval system is good at finding most of the relevant context available.\n",
        "- `Context Precision`: This metric focuses on the quality of the retrieved context by measuring the proportion of retrieved documents that are actually relevant to the query. Formally, it is calculated as `(Number of Relevant Items Retrieved) / (Total Number of Items Retrieved)`. In contrast to `Hit@k` (or \"Context Recall\") which emphasizes retrieving at least one relevant item within the top-K results, precision evaluates the relevance concentration within the retrieved set. Essentially, precision answers: \"Of all documents retrieved, how many were relevant?\".\n",
        "- `Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)`: Evaluates the ranking of retrieved documents by focusing on the position of the first relevant document in the ranked list. For each query, the Reciprocal Rank (RR) is calculated as 1 / rank, where rank is the position of the first relevant document. If there are no relevant documents in the retrieved list, RR is 0. MRR is then the mean of these reciprocal ranks across a set of queries. Generally, you shouldn't stress about this metric in your RAG application. This is largely because the benefit of having the most relevant context ranked at the top is less critical for LLMs.\n",
        "- `Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)`: A ranking-based metric that evaluates the quality of retrieved results by considering both relevance and position. Unlike Hit@k and MRR, which primarily focus on whether relevant items appear at the top, NDCG assigns higher importance to highly relevant documents appearing earlier in the ranked list. This metric can be useful when you have more than one relevant items and their relevancy has float labels instead of booleans.\n",
        "\n",
        "As for the generation metrics:\n",
        "- `Faithfulness`: Evaluates how grounded the LLM's answer is in the retrieved context. It measures whether the claims in the generated answer are supported by the provided context. Penalizes the hallucinations.\n",
        "- `Answer correctness`: Factual correctness of the response. Even though this is under `generation` category, this metric generally covers the whole RAG pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are only small subset of the all metrics, however we found these set of metrics to be reliable indicators of the whole RAG application performance. If you are curious about the list of all available metrics in the RAGAS, check it out [here](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/available_metrics/)!"
