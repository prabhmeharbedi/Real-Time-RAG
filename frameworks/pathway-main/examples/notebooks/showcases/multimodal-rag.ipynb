In multimodal search, you can find images based on text queries (text-to-image search) or text based on images (image-to-text search). This method maps data to a shared embedding space where items with similar meanings are grouped together.

        "## **Conclusion**\n",
        "This is how you can easily implement a Multimodal RAG Pipeline using GPT-4o and Pathway. You used the [BaseRAGQuestionAnswerer](https://pathway.com/developers/api-docs/pathway-xpacks-llm/question_answering/#pathway.xpacks.llm.question_answering.BaseRAGQuestionAnswerer) class from [pathway.xpacks](https://pathway.com/developers/user-guide/llm-xpack/overview/), which integrates the foundational components for our RAG application, including data ingestion, LLM integration, database creation and querying, and serving the application on an endpoint. For more advanced RAG options, you can explore [rerankers](https://pathway.com/developers/api-docs/pathway-xpacks-llm/rerankers/#pathway.xpacks.llm.rerankers.CrossEncoderReranker) and the [adaptive RAG example](https://pathway.com/developers/showcases/adaptive-rag).\n",
        "For implementing this example using open source LLMs, here\u2019s a [private RAG app template](https://pathway.com/developers/showcases/private-rag-ollama-mistral) that you can use as a starting point. It will help you run the entire application locally making it ideal for use-cases with sensitive data and explainable AI needs. You can do this within Docker as well by following the steps in [Pathway\u2019s LLM App templates](https://github.com/pathwaycom/llm-app/tree/main/examples/pipelines/gpt_4o_multimodal_rag) repository.\n",
