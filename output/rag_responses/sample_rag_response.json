    "text": "Based on the latest real-time data, there are currently two major supply chain disruptions affecting West Coast ports:\\n\\n1. **Severe Storm Warning at Los Angeles Port**: A major storm system is approaching with wind speeds of 60+ mph and heavy rainfall. Port operations are expected to be suspended for 6-8 hours, affecting approximately 45 vessels and causing delays for 12,500 tons of cargo.\\n\\n2. **Earthquake Impact in San Francisco Bay Area**: A magnitude 5.2 earthquake occurred near the Bay Area, potentially affecting the Port of San Francisco and Oakland Port. Infrastructure inspections are underway, with an estimated recovery time of 24-48 hours.\\n\\nBoth events are being actively monitored, and alternative shipping routes are being prepared to minimize supply chain impact.",
